# Embed SWF Emu

An easily embeddable url-query based page for the Ruffle Flash Emulator.

## why?
Ruffle is great but setting up to just put a simple swf on your web page can be slightly annoying.
So, I've made the whole process as easy as making an iframe.

## setup
Using this is as easy as just making an iframe with your swf in it!

### working example
```html
  <iframe width="800px" height="600px" src="https://swfemu.zombienw.com/?swf=https://swf.zombienw.com/Papa's%20Pizzeria.swf" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```
